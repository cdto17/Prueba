# Microservices of a streaming platform

<p>
The microservices project for a streaming platform tries to simulate a microservices architecture, it has three microservices: list services, song services and video services. Each of these microservices has independent functions such as listing the songs, playing the audio of the songs and videos of the songs. It should be noted that this is just a project, it is just a simulation of microservices.
Dockerfile and Docker-compose are also used for creating Docker images.
